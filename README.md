# bns-chrome-extension
*A chrome extension to automatically forward BNS names to their respective web bridges.*

Currently, in order to use .btc names you have to change your DNS servers or manually translate the domain name to the BTC.us web bridge. For example, alexander.btc becomes alexander.btc.us.

This chrome extension automatically rewrites .btc domains to their web bridge equivalent so you can avoid modifying your DNS servers.
